# An-Intelligent-License-Plate-Detection-and-Recognition-Model-using-Deep-Neural-Networks
One of the largest automotive sectors in the world is in India. The number of vehicles travelling by road has increased a lot in recent times. In malls or other crowded places, lots of vehicles enter and exit the parking area. Due to the increase in vehicles, a human can't note down the license plate number of all the vehicles passing in and out of the parking area. Hence, it is necessary to develop an Automatic License Plate Detection and Recognition Model (ALPDR) that recognize the license plate number of vehicles automatically. To automate this process we propose a three-step process that will detect the license plate, segment the characters and recognize the characters present in it. Detection is done by converting the input image to a bi-level image. Using region props the characters are segmented from the detected license plate. A two-layer CNN model is developed to recognize the segmented characters. The overall accuracy of the proposed model is 98.8%. The details of the car entering and exiting the parking area will be updated automatically in the database.
